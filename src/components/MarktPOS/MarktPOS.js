        Markt POS is a Grocey Store management platform and Point of Sale
        system. It is made for mom and pop grocers including butchers, ethnic
        markets, and health food stores. I was hired on this product at the
        startup phase as a Software Engineer. <br />
        <br />
        As the product grew I moved into the role of Product Manager. Due to the
        success of the product, we were acuired by Quilt Software in 2022. We
        have now grown to have 100s of stores all across America and millions in
        ARR.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my tenure I have:
        <br /> • Grown the team to 4 software engineers and 1 QA engineer.
        <br /> • Completed many integrations (Quickbooks, Twilio, ECommerce,
        Zapier)
        <br /> • Redesigned the UI, which led to the T.V. Show Supermarket Sweep
        using our system
